	But talking to people can be scary/hard, so I'll try and dump the answers to questions that I've heard here:<br>

		<h2>"Frequently" Asked Questions</h2>

	<h3>Q: Is there a way to impose for a book that opens right to left?</h3>
	<b>A:</b> If you normal-impose a PDF that has all its pages rotated 180 degrees you get a right-to-left book  <i>(thanks Lottie!)</i> -- there's also the <b style="font-family: monospace;">reverse PDF order</b> button in the <b>2. PDF Manipulation</b> section (useful if you want a reversed PDF to use for other things)

	<h3><img src="printer_edge.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px;">Q: Oh no! My printer ate the text at the edge of the page!</h3>
	<b>A:</b> Use the <b style="font-family: monospace;">Paper Margins</b> fields in the <b>3. Printer Paper</b> to specify how much space you need to hold in reserve for your printer. This space will only be applied at the edges of the page. There's a <b style="font-family: monospace;">Download Test Print</b> button that'll give you a PDF -- print that at 100% and count the black & white lines that are clipped/missing to figure out what margin your printer needs. (I use <b style="font-family: monospace;">13pt</b> on both top and bottom to completely avoid it)

	<h3>Q: How do I impose on Landscape orientated paper</h3>
	<b>A:</b> a lot of default papers are provided in <b>3. Printer Paper</b> section's dropdown. Note that the dimensions (in <b style="font-family: monospace;">pt</b>) are listed there. To rotate the paper, just type in a custom dimension that's the flip of the default. You don't need to <i>select</i> a custom dimension - just start typing in the text field and use <b style="font-family: monospace;">x</b> as the delimiter between the two values. <br>
