	<br>
	But talking to people can be scary/hard/slow, so I'll try and dump the answers to questions that I've heard here:<br>

		<h1>"Frequently" Asked Questions</h1>
		<sub><i>(more like, "asked at least once")</i></sub>
	</center>

	<h3>Q: Is there a way to impose for a book that opens right to left?</h3>
	<b>A:</b> If you normal-impose a PDF that has all its pages rotated 180 degrees you get a right-to-left book  <i>(thanks Lottie!)</i> -- there's also the <b style="font-family: monospace;">reverse PDF order</b> button in the <b>2. PDF Manipulation</b> section (useful if you want a reversed PDF to use for other things)
	<br>


	<h3><img src="printer_edge.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px;">Q: Oh no! My printer ate the text at the edge of the page!</h3>
	<b>A:</b> Use the <b style="font-family: monospace;">Paper Margins</b> fields in the <b>3. Printer Paper</b> to specify how much space you need to hold in reserve for your printer. This space will only be applied at the edges of the page. There's a <b style="font-family: monospace;">Download Test Print</b> button that'll give you a PDF -- print that at 100% and count the black & white lines that are clipped/missing to figure out what margin your printer needs. (I use <b style="font-family: monospace;">13pt</b> on both top and bottom to completely avoid it) <br>( &#128517; image thanks to Renedade peep who's name I've forgotten ((remind me if it's you!)) )

	<h3>Q: How do I impose on Landscape orientated paper</h3>
	<b>A:</b> a lot of default papers are provided in <b>3. Printer Paper</b> section's dropdown. Note that the dimensions (in <b style="font-family: monospace;">pt</b>) are listed there. To rotate the paper, just type in a custom dimension that's the flip of the default. You don't need to <i>select</i> a custom dimension - just start typing in the text field and use <b style="font-family: monospace;">x</b> as the delimiter between the two values. <br>

	<h3>Q: How can I impose a Tiny landscape?</h3>
	<b>A:</b> At the time of the asking (mid April) there was no Tiny Landscape- nothing optimally used the paper space. BB made it work using the sextodecimal imposition but had to squander half the paper. This is a reminder that not everything is possible yet and you should be vocal and ask if you'd like that to change. And if you <i>want</i> it changed, be prepared to help me with screenshots and photos to understand what it is you're struggling with. Also a reminder that even if the tool doesn't support it, there are creative work arounds lurking (thank's for the images & ask, BB!)<br>

		<h1>Test Files</h1>
	</center>
	Sometimes it's easier to figure things out with test PDFs than the fancy PDFs we want to actually print (that often have blank pages or missing page numbers) -- feel free to check out the test PDFs (and the <code>.tex</code> files used to generate them) that I've uploaded to the Github repo <a href="https://github.com/sithel/vip/tree/main/tests">HERE</a>. 
	<p>
	In particular, I find <code><a href="https://sithel.github.io/vip/tests/example_page_numbers.pdf">example_page_numbers.pdf</a></code> and <code><a href="https://sithel.github.io/vip/tests/example_page_numbers_landscape.pdf">example_page_numbers_landscape.pdf</a></code> to be quite helpful.
